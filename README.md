# ShooterGame
## What is it?
This is a basic 2-D tile based game which allows a player to control a character in the game and defeat enemies. The character can move around on the game screen and shoot bullets at the enemies which are programmed to try and attack the main character. The objective of the game is simple- shoot and kill as many of the randomly-spawning enemies as possible. The player's score is tracked and also displayed on the screen. The game has been made using pygame, a popular python library used to create simple games. We have tried our best to incorporate as many effects as we could- like the music, sound effects, player and NPC animation and other visual effects. Hope you enjoy playing the game!

## How to play?
Use the arrow keys to control your character and use the space-bar to shoot. The shots are in the direction of movement of the character(the direction in which the character is facing) If the enemy has been shot, it disappears and another one is spawned somewhere else on the screen randomly.

## How to execute the code:
Make sure your system has pygame installed. If it isn't already installed, install it using pip. Now, simply execute 'python3 main.py' to run the game. The terminal should display the instructions and objective of the game once again and also open the game window. There is a delay before the game starts so the player can read the instructions. Hit any key and begin playing!

## Future Progress
This game is also connected to a mysql database using the python mysql-connecter. That part of the code is commented out so that the game still works in case you want to run the game on a system that doesn't have mysql installed. However, you can un-comment the marked lines to get it to work.
Note- For this, you will need to have mysql installed and set up.
